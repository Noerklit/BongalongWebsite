## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.



## Notes for myself
### How to run
```
npm run dev
```

### Routing
Create a folder named after what endpoint you want for it - all files related to this endpoint will be located in this folder, but only the page.tsx is public, and that is what will be shown at the endpoint as far as I understand it.
